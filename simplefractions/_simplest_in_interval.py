    """
    Simplest fraction between two other fractions in the positive real line.

    This is the core algorithm. Given a nonempty, possibly infinite,
    subinterval of the positive real line whose endpoints are rational numbers,
    it finds the unique simplest rational number in that subinterval.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ln, ld : int
        Numerator and denominator of the left endpoint of the interval.
        Can be 0 and 1 (respectively) to represent zero.
    lh : bool
        True if left endpoint is included in the interval, else False.
        Must be False if the left endpoint is zero.
    rn, rd : int
        Numerator and denominator of the right endpoint of the interval.
        Can be 1 and 0 (respectively) to represent infinity.
    rh : bool
        True if the right endpoint *is* included in the interval, else False.
        Must be False if the right endpoint is infinity.

    Returns
    -------
    n, d : int
        Numerator and denominator of the simplest fraction in the interval.

    Simplest fraction in a subinterval of the real line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : fractions.Fraction, optional
        Left endpoint of the interval. If not given, the left
        endpoint is -infinity.
    right : fractions.Fraction, optional
        Right endpoint of the interval. If not given, the right
        end point is infinity.
    include_left : bool, optional
        True if the left endpoint should be included in the interval.
        The default is False. Must be False if the left endpoint is -infinity.
