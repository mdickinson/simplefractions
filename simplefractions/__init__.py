Given fractions x = a/b and y = c/d, written in lowest terms in the
normal way, say that x is *simpler* than y if:

- abs(a) <= abs(c), and
- b <= d, and
- abs(x) != abs(y)

Then it can be proved that any subinterval of the real line that contains at
least one fraction contains a unique simplest fraction - that is, there's a
fraction x contained in the given interval, such that x is simpler than all
other fractions in that interval.

It follows that given a finite Python float ``f``, there's a unique simplest
fraction ``x`` such that ``float(x)`` recovers ``f``.

This module provides two functions: ``simplest_in_subinterval`` finds the
simplest fraction in a given interval, while ``simplest_from_float`` finds
the simplest fraction that converts to the given float.
