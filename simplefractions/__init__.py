Given fractions x = a/b and y = c/d, written in lowest terms in the
normal way, say that x is *simpler* than y if:

- abs(a) <= abs(c), and
- b <= d, and
- abs(x) != abs(y)

Then it can be proved that any subinterval of the real line that contains at
least one fraction contains a unique simplest fraction - that is, there's a
fraction x contained in the given interval, such that x is simpler than all
other fractions in that interval.

It follows that given a finite Python float ``f``, there's a unique simplest
fraction ``x`` such that ``float(x)`` recovers ``f``.

This module provides two functions: ``simplest_in_subinterval`` finds the
simplest fraction in a given interval, while ``simplest_from_float`` finds
the simplest fraction that converts to the given float.

# Theory: the Stern-Brocot tree contains every positive rational exactly once.
# By creating a second copy of the tree for negative numbers and adding
# an extra node labelled "0" at the top (and connected to the root nodes
# of the negative and positive trees) we get a infinite full binary tree with
# nodes labelled by rational numbers, and with every rational number appearing
# on exactly one node.

# Note that each rational in the tree is simpler than all rationals that
# descend from it.
#
# Any infinite string of "L" and "R" characters maps to a path in the tree, by
# starting from the root node and taking the left or right branch at each node
# as dictated by successive characters in the string. As the path passes
# through the nodes it generates a sequence of rationals, and that sequence
# converges to a limit in ℝ ∪ {-∞, ∞}. So we get a mapping from those infinite
# strings to ℝ ∪ {-∞, ∞}. That mapping is order-preserving with respect to the
# lexicographic order on the strings, and it's surjective but not injective:
# irrationals and infinites each arise from a single infinite string, but each
# rational is the image of two infinite strings, of the form <p>LRRR... and
# <p>RLLL..., where <p> is the finite path to the position of that rational in
# the tree.
#
# Call the two infinite string representations of a rational number the *left*
# and *right* representations respectively (the left one ending in LRRR..., and
# the right one ending in RLLL...).
#
# Example: the fraction 2/3 has representations RLRLRRR... and RLRRLLL...
# as an infinite string.
#
# The task of finding the (unique) simplest rational in an interval reduces to
# the task of finding the longest common prefix of the corresponding paths. In
# more detail, to find the unique simplest rational in a closed interval [x, y]
# with x <= y rational numbers, find the left representation of x and the right
# representation of y, take the longest common prefix (which will be a finite
# string of Ls and Rs), and take the rational corresponding to that path. For
# an open interval (x, y) with x < y, do the same but start instead with the
# right representation of x and the left representation of y. Extend in the
# obvious way for infinite endpoints or half-open intervals.
#
# Practical computation requires an efficient representation of the paths. We
# use run-length encoding: each path is represented by a sequence of positive
# integers giving the numbers of Ls and Rs, augmented by a math.inf marker
# indicating an infinite tail of Ls or Rs. We also need to indicate whether
# each sequence starts with a run of Ls or a run or Rs.
#
# Example: the fraction 2/3 is represented by the sequences [1, 1, 1, 1, inf]
# and [1, 1, 2, inf] of path lengths, starting with a sequence of "R" steps
# in each case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : int, float or Fraction, optional

        Right endpoint of the interval. If not provided, the interval is
        assumed unbounded to the right.
    include_left : bool, optional
        If True, the left endpoint is included in the interval. The default
        is False. If the left endpoint is missing, include_left must be False.
